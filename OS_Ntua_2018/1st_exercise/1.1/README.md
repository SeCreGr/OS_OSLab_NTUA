# NEW STUFF HERE:
###### MAKEFILES  
* Make a zing.c file that has a function zing(), that types a message.
* Call it from main.c.
* Use zing.h to declare the function zing().
* Implement the above in a Makefile.
* Make a zing2.c file that calls zing(), which prints something else this time.
* Change the Makefile to output also a zing2 executable file.
