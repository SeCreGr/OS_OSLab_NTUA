1)Make a zing.c file that has a function zing(), that types a message.
2)Call it from main.c.
3)Use zing.h to declare the function zing().
4)Implement the above in a Makefile.
5)Make a zing2.c file that calls zing(), which prints something else this time.
6)Change the Makefile to output also a zing2 executable file.
